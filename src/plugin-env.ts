/**
 * Plugin-owned environment variables live under `DSHPLUGIN_`, never `DSH_`.
 *
 * DSH reserves the ENTIRE `DSH_` prefix for host bootstrap settings and
 * refuses to load any `.env` file that sets one: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-app-boot`
 * (`BOOTSTRAP_PREFIXES`) throws on the first match, rejects the whole file,
 * and `dsh web` aborts at startup. A user who configured this plugin the way
 * DSH teaches — `~/.dsh/.env`, or the working directory's `.env` — therefore
 * took the host down with an error naming a variable this plugin owns
 * (reported as dsh-openpencil issue #6; the trap is family-wide).
 *
 * Legacy `DSH_`-prefixed names are still READ so existing shell exports keep
 * working; they are removed in the first 1.0.0 prerelease. Reading them cannot
 * make them work in a `.env` file — the host rejects that file before any
 * plugin loads — which is why migration means REPLACING the old assignment,
 * never adding the new name beside it.
